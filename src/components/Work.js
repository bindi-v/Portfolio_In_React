                <p> As a full stack web developer, I am known as an innovative problem solver passionate about developing apps, 
                    with a focus on mobile-first design and development. With each project, my aim is to best engage my
                    audience for an impactful user experience. I applied aspects of UX and agile development in a
                    recent project. I worked on a team of four to develop an app that we deployed on Heroku. Iâ€™m excited to
                    leverage my skills as part of a fast-paced, quality-driven team to build better experiences on the
                    web.</p>
